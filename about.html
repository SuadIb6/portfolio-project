                <p>I'm Suad, a primary school teacher who is now beginning a new journey into coding. I have been
                    teaching
                    for
                    11 years, teaching children key skills that will support them in their learning journey and the
                    wider
                    world.
                    It has been a rewarding and fufilling experience seeing students discover their passion, experience
                    success
                    in learning, or come to understand the importance of perseverance.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Teaching has allowed me to develop my creativity and discover my own passions. This is where coding
                    comes
                    into place. I have always been interested in technology and how it works. In my teaching career
                    incorporating technology has been an important part especially as it has become part of our daily
                    lives.
                    Coding helps us to understand technology.

                    Our world is full of technology, we use numerous software and apps every day. When you know how to
                    build
                    these things and understand their mechanism, you will feel more confident.
                    You don't need to be an expert to be self-sufficient, by knowing just a little can make a huge
                    difference to
                    your life. Learning to code can help your life in a way you can never imagine.
